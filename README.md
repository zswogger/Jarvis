### Jarvis
---
Jarvis is a simple voice powered assistant written in C#.NET. It works very similar to the Alexa and Siri assistants.
Jarvis also keeps a list of previously issued commands on its UI.
It can only respond to designated commands such as:
"Open Edge"
"New Tab"
"Open Chrome"
"Open Outlook" - Will not open duplicate application. Will open pre-existing instance if it is already open
"Close" - Close Jarvis
"Exit Application" - Exit focused application
